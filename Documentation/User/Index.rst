Users Manual
============

To create paywalled content create a new content-element of type "Satoshipay" on the page where the content should be displayed.


.. figure:: ../Images/UserManual/UserContentElement.png
   :width: 500px
   :alt: content element

   content element in web/page view

In the "plugin" tab you can create a new good

   :alt: create good

   Create a new good
   
After that, define a title and a price and the Type (currently supported: content, image or download).

Type: Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the default type. It allows you to create as many content elements as you like.

.. figure:: ../Images/UserManual/GoodTypeContent.png
   :width: 500px
   :alt: content elements

   Edit a good with content elements

Type: Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a type supported by SatoshiPay as of July 22nd 2016. It allows you display a single image. In This mode you can define the width and height of the container, define an Image and an (optional) teaser image.

If you do not define a teaser image a blurred image of the original will be rendered by this extension and used as a placeholder.

You may define a width and height for the image - if you don't, it will fall back to SatoshiPay's default settings (wich is a 250x250 square). 

.. figure:: ../Images/UserManual/GoodTypeImage.png
   :width: 500px
   :alt: image good

   Edit an image good
   

.. figure:: ../Images/UserManual/GoodTypeImageTeaser.png
   :width: 500px
   :alt: image good teaser
   
   This is how a paywalled image will be shown in the frontend


Type: File (Download)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a type supported by SatoshiPay as of July 22nd 2016. It allows you paywall a file download (PDF for example).

.. figure:: ../Images/UserManual/GoodTypeFileFrontend.png
   :width: 500px
   :alt: frontend
   
   This is how a paywalled download will be shown in the frontend



Tab Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Configuration Tab stores SatoshiPay information. Unless you know exactly what you are doing you don't need to change anything here.

.. warning::

   Do not set the "Good Id" in tab "Configuration" unless you know exactly what you're doing. It will be set automatically after initializing the good with SatoshiPay.
